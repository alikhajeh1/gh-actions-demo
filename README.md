# Infracost CI Demo

See [this pull request](https://github.com/infracost/ci-demo/pull/13) for the demo.

The [Infracost GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-infracost) can be used to automatically add a pull request comment showing the cost estimate difference (similar to `git diff`) between a pull request and the master branch whenever Terraform files change.

See the [Infracost integrations](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/) page for other integrations.
